Allow me to introduce myself: I’m Geoffrey Hendrikx, a graduate of two universities in the Netherlands and the founder & Lead Programmer of Enchanted Works. We are currently crafting a game called Nomori, a project close to my heart.

One of the first programming principles I learned was DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Yet, as the years passed and my experience grew, I began to notice that some things inevitably find themselves repeated.
Where I want to write about today is one of the most hated game design pattern The Singleton.

<h1>what's wrong with a singleton?</h1> 

Why do people use it or why don't they use it? 
Why is it also called a anti pattern? 
Why are alot of youtubers using it?



The singleton pattern gives programmer a false impression of a good design pattern. It's easy to use and it's simple and for a game jam, ofcourse why not.

SOLID

It's funny how much you learn in the first year
but not always can place it ib your program
