One of the first programming principles I learned was DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Yet, as the years passed and my experience grew, I began to notice that some things inevitably find themselves repeated.

Allow me to introduce myself: I’m Geoffrey Hendrikx, a graduate of two universities in the Netherlands and the founder of Enchanted Works. We are currently crafting a game called Nomori, a project close to my heart.

Where I want to write about today is one of the most hated game design pattern. 
The Singleton

 The Singleton design pattern. As you noticed singletons are one of the most hated game design patterns,
But why what's wrong with a singleton? Why do people use it or why don't they use it.

The singleton pattern gives programmer a false impression of a good design pattern. It's easy to use and it's simple and for a game jam, ofcourse why not.


It's funny how much you learn in the first year
but not always can place it ib your program
