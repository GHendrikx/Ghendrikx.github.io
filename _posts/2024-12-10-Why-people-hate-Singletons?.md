One of the first programming principles I learned was DRY—Don’t Repeat Yourself. Yet, as the years passed and my experience grew, I began to notice that some things inevitably find themselves repeated.

Allow me to introduce myself: I’m Geoffrey Hendrikx, a graduate of two universities in the Netherlands and the founder of Enchanted Works. We are currently crafting a game called Nomori, a project close to my heart.

Where I want to write about today is. The Singleton design pattern. As you noticed singletons are one of the most hated game design patterns,
But why what's wrong with a singleton? Why do people use it or why don't they use it.
The Singleton is also known as a anti pattern

It's funny how much you learn in the first year
but not always can place it ib your program
